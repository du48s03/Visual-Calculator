\subsection{Skin color detection}
Because of our settings, there are only white background, shadow and the hand in an image.
So we detect the hand by color. 
In particular, we define the skin colr as:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The difference of Red and Green is larger than 20
  \item The difference of Red and Blue is larger than 20
 \end{itemize}
