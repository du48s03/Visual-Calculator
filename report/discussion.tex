\section{Discussion}
There are four reasons that the system does not perform well.
\subsection{Processing time}
The processing time for each process is too slow to do real time video processing.
We should have use the information from the previous frame so that we don't have to search all of the regions or recognize the similar posture again.
\subsection{The outside condition of light}
The outside condition of light is not stable. It effects the skin and shadow detection.
We should have make the outside condition fixed like trying in a room without window.
