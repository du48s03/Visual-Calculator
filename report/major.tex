\subsection{Orientation of the hand}
In order to detect the hand region, it is useful to find the orientation of the hand.
In our program, major axis.py implements this function.
We define the orientation of the hand as the angle of the axis with the least second moment.\par
The input is the binary image of skin region.
Axis with the least second moment minimizes E, the sum of the distance from all points to the line. That is,
$$E = \int \int r(x,y)^2 b(x,y) dxdy$$
where $r(x,y)$ is the distance from the pixel (x,y) to the axis and b(x,y) = 1 if and only if the pixel belongs to the hand.
Let the axis be $x\sin{\theta} - y\sin{\theta} + \rho = 0$.
The distance of point (x,y) from axis is:
$$r = |x\sin{\theta}-y\cos{\theta}+\rho|$$.
Thus minimizing $E$ means minimizing
$$E = \int\int (x\sin{\theta}-y\cos{\theta}+\rho)^2 b(x,y)dxdy$$
Setting $\partial E / \partial \rho = 0$, we get
$$A(x_c \sin{\theta} - y_c \cos{\theta} + \rho) = 0$$
where $A$ is an area of the hand and $(x_c,y_c)$ is center of the hand.
This means, the axis should pass the center point of the object.
Then, we shift the coordinate system in order to set the center point as origin.
That is, 
$x'= x - x_c, y' = y - y_c$.
Because this line should pass the origin, the line can be represented as
$x'\sin{\theta}-y'\cos{\theta}$
So, $$E = a \sin^2{\theta} - b\sin{\theta}\cos{\theta} + c\cos^2{\theta}$$.
Where $a = \int\int (x')^2 b(x,y) dx'dy', b = 2\int\int x'y' b(x,y) dx'dy', 
c = \int\int (y')^2 b(x,y)dx'dy'$.\par
Setting $\partial E / \partial \theta = 0$, we get
$$(a-c)\sin{2\theta} - b\cos{2\theta} = 0$$
Also, minimizing E means the second derivative is larger than 0.
Using these information, the orientation $\theta = atan2(b,a-c)/2$.\par
Fig.\ref{fig:mom2} shows the results of orientation detection and the rotated image.
The first column is the original image.
The second column is the translated image. First, the center of the hand is moved to the center of the image.
The light blue line is the axis. The blue dot is the center point.
For the mask, the image is rotated by the angle of $-\theta$ and translated to the original position.
The figure shows that this axis does not depends on the small fingertip movement.
If the binary image of hand has enough amount of areas, this system can detect the angle of the hand stably.
If the image of hand does not have enough amount of areas, for example, it can detect only a part of fingers,
and not the the angle of the whole hand.
However, because of our settings, we can always see enough amount of hand pixels in the target area.
